# Basic AWS Sign In
Learning about making an AWS backed sign-in flow in an android app.

I am using the basic architecture of the Android Studio Sign in template with AWS Cognito sign in as the backend.

Flow consists of a home landing page, a login for existing users, create a new user login, and a confirmation page for new user sign up.
